Using setup.py for creating RHEL9 RPMs works but running jvmctl will be met with the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/jvmctl", line 33, in <module>
    sys.exit(load_entry_point('jvmctl==0.6.0', 'console_scripts', 'jvmctl')())
  File "/usr/bin/jvmctl", line 25, in importlib_load_entry_point
    return next(matches).load()
StopIteration

The reason turned out to be that the egginfo directory for the previous version was not removed.
RHEL9 suffers from this but RHEL8 works fine, even with all the extra directories.

On spade there is a rich history of egginfo directories

It is quite possible logduct and sendlog may suffer from the same problem.

Attempts were made for a post-install script in setup.py to clean up the extra directories, but nothing worked.
To combat this, the build for jvmctl was moved to a SPEC file.

To run a build, from the top level jvmctl directory, run:
    build_rpm_for_RHEL.sh jvmctl 9   (or 8 for RHEL8, or 10 for RHEL10)

There is a dependancy on the build containers being present, and you may wish to have the bssadmin gpg key imported for signing the RPM

alex.nla.gov.au has the necessary podman setup
